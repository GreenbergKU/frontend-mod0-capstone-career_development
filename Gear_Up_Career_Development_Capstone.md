## Gear Up Pre-Work
### Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers

<!-- markdown comments  -->


_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Read
Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?


* THE TWO...<!-- **I READ THESE TWO ARTICLES ** --> I CHOOSE:

<!-- ["Why is Empathy Important for Design"](http://www.bresslergroup.com/blog/why-empathic-design/) -->

* ["The Surprising (Nontechnical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-and-nontechnical-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-tech), _The Muse_  


<!-- ["Why Aren't We More Compassionate?"](http://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goleman_on_compassion#t-39146), TED Talk (Daniel Goleman) -->


* ["Can you teach people to have empathy?"](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33287727), BBC (Jun 29, 2015)

## Reflect

After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.

### What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?

- [ ] I have a twin sister and her entire existance has been in a constant battle with depression.  She would get so wrapped up in these false realities that she herself created.  She would search for small tidbits of information that that would reinforce her dilusion.  Since she was convinced that everyone was out to get her she would respond with with sudden emotional outbursts and an attitude full of sarcasm and resentment.  No one but me and a few really close friends were aware of her state of mind so her behavior was unpredictable, unreasonable irrational and misunderstood.  Most of high school was spent trying to get inside her head.  I knew if I could see her reality throhgh the same lens that she did, I could try and present the world to her in a way that she could understand and relate to.  By senior year if I would saw her beginning to spiral, I could, very subltly, incorporate just enough of whichever reality she was experiencing and mix that into a more grounded rational reality that she felt comfortable with.  

### How does empathy help you build better software?


- [ ] So this is all just hypothetical because I have yet to build  software, let along, 'better' software.  But a girl can dream... and I see myslelf bridging that gap betwwen developers and the general public.  

- [ ] I would imagaine that since a lot of technical firms have incorporated the use of teams and group instead of '1 man teams', empathy helps those individual identities work together in a group. 

- [ ] Empathy comes into play when you think of the group dynamics and office politics.  A very interesting method called, Radical Listening was mentioned in one of my reading.  When temperes flare or disagreements arisee this method suggests the involved parties repeat what the other person said before they can contiue with the convversation on.  The repetition forces you to actually listen and then confirms that you have been listening, which that validation alone can minimize confrontation.
- [ ] If software, designed for a small, specific, group of people, could also be utilized by a larger majority of people, then it benefits the company, the software designers and the public.  The knowlege and experiences of many different people combine to provide a muiti-perspective view which should allow for software they develop to be relevant for as many people as possible.  


### Why is empathy important for working on a team?

- [ ] Let people have their say, void interrupting, listening is apreciated by the speaker because it gives them a since that do matter.  

- [ ] Empathy is at the core of a process called, 'Radical Listening', which claims to yield conflict resolution 50% faster, therefore, spending less time on 'office politics' and more time  getting the job done.  

- [ ] Emathy can yield patience and better listening because since everyone wants to be heard when thery are talking.  By self-identifying that characteristic, better listening skills emerge simply because that is what you wanted other to do for you.  

- [ ] Empathy can promote creativity by allowing ideas to bounce off eachother until one person's idea becomes a group consciousness.  Every person has a unique story, so everyone contributes in different ways. Helping individuals to feel comfortable in their environment can promote brain storming and the flow of ideas by everyone. 

### Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.

- [ ] Last week in my Mod 0 online class, a girl in my 'breakout' group had her video turned off so I told her because I assumed it was an accident.  Turns out it was no accident because she explained how sick she was and warned us that her contribution was going to be minimal.

- [ ] As soon as she explained her situation the others and I immediately began to voice our concern and understanding.  So both empathy and communication work together to establish a concinsous by everyone, which is important because you want everone on the same page.


### When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?


- [ ] I do not have a high tolerance for individuals who do not carry their own weight in a group project.  I especially do not have a high tolerance for individuals who come up with excuse, after excuse, for their shortcomings.  I can empathise when life throws a curve ball, I would never hold that against them, but how they handle that is what matters.

- [ ]  I think I can improve my skills by creating situations that avoid that senario all together.  
    - I believe it benefits the group to establish some ground rules, or guidlines, at the very beginning, so that everyone knows what is expected of them.
    - When/if the inability to do assigned task(s) arises, avoid fallout by communicating to fellow group members as soon as possible.  
    - If there is time, responsibilities can be redistributed without affecting the timeline and thus avoiding harsh reprocussions for not making a deadline.

- [ ] If I was presented with this senario, I can improve my skills by stopping and taking a few deep breaths.  This helps me to get my emotions incheck, reminds me to keep my mouth shut and avoids me saying things I don't mean or things I cannot take back later.

- [ ] I have to tell myself that I'm almost certain that this is a senario that everyone, including myself, has been in before.  I have to try and reserve judgement for repeated offenses of this nature, and have faith in my fellow group memeber that they learn from this and grow because of it.
